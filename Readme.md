Lego Case for Arduino Uno
=========================

![Lego Case](header.jpg)

This is a smart case for your Arduino Uno built with Lego.
Its made with mostly available bricks so you can build your own.

**This Repository contains:**
* LDD (Lego Digital Designer) file
* Pictures
* Html building Instructions

**Note:** In my case I used a special fence brick which is a bit wider.
But I couldn't find this brick in the LDD. If anyone knows the brick ID, please message me.
The other brick is just a bit thinner. Picture of this brick is in the repository.
